# ERTS WebAssembly runtime stack

## Scope

This map routes through the evidence for a BlazeX-owned browser port of the
official Erlang/OTP runtime: ERTS internals, cross-building, browser threads
and operating-system gaps, minimal OTP boot, security, performance, and the
experiment needed before adoption.

It preserves four independent axes: ERTS is the runtime substrate; a directly
supervised browser Worker group keeps ERTS off the UI thread; the BlazeX DOM
adapter is the renderer; and any Phoenix or Plug connection is a separate
server adapter. LiveView and
LocalLiveView are deferred and are not part of this runtime investigation.

## Start here

- [First-party Erlang/OTP ERTS WebAssembly runtime
  stack](../20-notes/first-party-erlang-otp-erts-webassembly-runtime-stack.md)
  is the complete synthesis, recommended architecture, security model, staged
  proof program, and current recommendation.
- [Can BlazeX build and own an ERTS WebAssembly runtime
  stack?](../40-inquiries/can-blazex-build-and-own-an-erts-webassembly-runtime-stack.md)
  turns the proposal into falsifiable boot, semantics, host-boundary,
  lifecycle, supply-chain, and product-budget criteria.
- [2026-09-13 first-party ERTS WebAssembly runtime deep
  dive](../50-journal/2026-09-13-first-party-erts-webassembly-runtime-deep-dive.md)
  records the pinned local source audit, commands, negative findings, evidence
  limits, and research method.

## Runtime internals and upstream baseline

- [The BEAM Book](../30-sources/stenman-2025-beam-book.md) explains the
  distinction between BEAM and ERTS plus process representation, instruction
  loading, reductions, scheduler loops, memory, garbage collection, I/O,
  ports, and native extensions.
- [Erlang/OTP ERTS build, runtime, and source
  architecture](../30-sources/erlang-otp-project-2026-erts-build-runtime-and-source.md)
  records the immutable OTP 29.0.6 / ERTS 17.0.6 audit, cross-build path,
  mandatory threading, interpreter/JIT split, platform seams, allocator
  assumptions, and native boundaries.
- [Efficient Memory Management for Concurrent Programs that Use Message
  Passing](../30-sources/sagonas-wilhelmsson-2006-erlang-memory-management.md)
  supplies the scientific basis for process-local heaps, copied messages, and
  low-pause collection as both a semantic asset and aggregate memory cost.
- [Scaling Reliably](../30-sources/trinder-et-al-2017-scaling-reliably-erlang.md)
  records how scheduler balancing, time, timers, and ETS evolved under measured
  contention, cautioning against casually simplifying current ERTS internals.

## OTP boot, compatibility, and authority

- [Erlang/OTP boot, security, and browser
  compatibility](../30-sources/erlang-otp-project-2026-otp-boot-security-and-compatibility.md)
  traces startup from ERTS through `init`, release scripts, `kernel`, `stdlib`,
  behaviours, code loading, and current untrusted-data guidance.
- The [main synthesis](../20-notes/first-party-erlang-otp-erts-webassembly-runtime-stack.md#how-otp-fits-into-the-stack)
  explains why official version-matched OTP BEAM modules should execute inside
  ERTS-in-Wasm rather than be rewritten as JavaScript or C.
- The [compatibility experiment](../40-inquiries/can-blazex-build-and-own-an-erts-webassembly-runtime-stack.md#e3-deterministic-release-and-compatibility-closure)
  requires `.app`, BEAM import, native artifact, on-load, runtime trace, and
  declared-capability evidence rather than a dependency list alone.

## Browser platform and WebAssembly boundary

- [Emscripten browser porting, pthreads, and runtime
  services](../30-sources/emscripten-project-2026-browser-porting-runtime.md)
  covers Autoconf/C builds, pthread Workers and shared memory, asynchronous
  browser APIs, virtual filesystems, networking limits, dynamic linking, and
  sanitizers.
- [WebAssembly browser security, isolation, and threading
  standards](../30-sources/webassembly-standards-2026-browser-security-and-threads.md)
  establishes import-scoped authority, linear-memory isolation, Workers,
  `SharedArrayBuffer`, COOP/COEP, CSP, and the limits of those guarantees.
- [Browsix](../30-sources/powers-vilk-berger-2017-browsix.md) demonstrates that
  reconstructing Unix abstractions in a browser is possible but substantial,
  supporting a smaller capability-specific host contract for BlazeX.
- [WASI and WebAssembly threading proposal
  status](../30-sources/webassembly-project-2026-wasi-and-threading-status.md)
  distinguishes Core shared-memory atomics, legacy `wasi-threads`, evolving
  Shared-Everything Threads, and the browser embedder work none of them removes.

## Security trail

- [Everything Old Is New Again](../30-sources/lehmann-kinder-pradel-2020-webassembly-binary-security.md)
  shows how unsafe-language bugs can still corrupt state inside Wasm linear
  memory and turn a powerful host import into an origin-visible exploit.
- [Swivel](../30-sources/narayan-et-al-2021-swivel.md), a Lucet native-x86
  study rather than a browser/ERTS implementation, establishes the narrower
  point that sequential Wasm guarantees alone do not prove speculative
  confidentiality; browser-engine mitigations remain in the trusted base.
- The synthesis's [day-one security
  model](../20-notes/first-party-erlang-otp-erts-webassembly-runtime-stack.md#security-from-day-one)
  combines immutable code, capability brokering, bounded protocols, quotas,
  secret minimization, Worker recovery, reproducible builds, and rapid ERTS
  patching.
- The inquiry's [security blockers](../40-inquiries/can-blazex-build-and-own-an-erts-webassembly-runtime-stack.md#security-blockers)
  prevent a visually successful demo from being mistaken for a safe runtime.

## Performance and lifecycle trail

- [Not So Fast](../30-sources/jangda-et-al-2019-webassembly-performance.md)
  supplies the methodological warning that whole native applications can
  expose costs hidden by small kernels and that browser, host-shim, compiler,
  and steady-state measurements must be separated.
- The synthesis's [required
  measurements](../20-notes/first-party-erlang-otp-erts-webassembly-runtime-stack.md#required-measurements)
  cover artifact bytes, boot phases, memory, workers, scheduler behavior,
  event-to-paint latency, repeated teardown, and cleanup slopes.
- The inquiry's [minimal boot](../40-inquiries/can-blazex-build-and-own-an-erts-webassembly-runtime-stack.md#e1-minimal-erts-and-otp-boot)
  and [adversarial resource
  trial](../40-inquiries/can-blazex-build-and-own-an-erts-webassembly-runtime-stack.md#e5-adversarial-resource-and-product-trial)
  are the two decisive proof gates.

## Origin and project boundary

This map originated in the BlazeX research corpus, where ERTS, browser Workers,
the DOM renderer, component semantics, and server adapters were treated as
separate axes. The standalone archive now owns the runtime investigation and
must not infer current BlazeX package ownership or roadmap authority from the
historical framing.

No ERTS-in-Wasm implementation package exists in this corpus. Any runtime code,
repository relationship, or BlazeX integration requires an explicit decision
and independently validated implementation plan.

## Current evidence boundary

The research establishes a plausible architecture and a bounded way to falsify
it. It does not establish a successful cross-build, OTP boot, browser
component, cleanup result, performance envelope, support matrix, or maintenance
commitment. The central inquiry remains open until those artifacts exist.
